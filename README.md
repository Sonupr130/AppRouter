## Usage

Using **AppRouter** is straightforward. First, import the library into your SwiftUI views:

import AppRouter
```

Next, set up your routes and manage navigation using the provided API. Here's a simple example:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                    Text("Go to Detail View")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example to demonstrate how to use **AppRouter** in your SwiftUI application.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AppRouter

struct MainView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Router {
            Route(path: "/home") {
                HomeView()
            }
            Route(path: "/details") {
                DetailView()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Home View")
            NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                Text("Go to Detail")
            }
        }
    }
}

struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Detail View")
    }
}
```

This example sets up a basic navigation structure using **AppRouter**. You can easily expand this to include more routes and views as needed.
